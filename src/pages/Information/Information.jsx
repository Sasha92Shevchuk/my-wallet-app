          Summary Ethereum is a network of computers all over the world that
          follow a set of rules called the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum
          network acts as the foundation for communities, applications,
          organizations and digital assets that anyone can build and use. You

          do all this without trusting a central authority that could change the
          rules or restrict your access. Keep reading to learn moreâ€¦
